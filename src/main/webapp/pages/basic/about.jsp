    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="left">Dynamics +Gain was founded by me, Mike.
    Yeah, I admit it, I've been homeless. You
    know what the worst part about it is, most people
    don't give a poop. That's where we come in.
    We are aware of the problem of
    disparity and offer a portal for you to donate.
    In addition, we find a whole bunch of
    people who care and allow you to give them money as well.
    Dynamic +Gain is a gateway to all the
    organizations we can find that act on the
    behalf of others and allow you to invest in
        them!</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">How does it work?</h3>
    <p class="left">100% of your donation goes toward the organization you select
    or to Dynamics <strong>+Gain</strong>, your choice.
        The organization has signed up to be on our list and
    has gone through the registration process to link their account.
    None of your donation goes to us unless you choose.</p>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">What's up with the name?</h3>
    <p class="left">Well, I recalled what it felt like to be without.
        It was pretty disheartening. Calling someone Dynamic is a
        pretty big compliment, so they, the people in need are...
        Dynamics <strong>+Gain</strong>.

    <p>Thank you.</p>
